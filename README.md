## Password Generator
This is a simple password generator implemented in Python. The generator allows you to specify the minimum length for the password and whether you want to include numbers and special characters in the generated password.
## How to start the app
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
## Running the Script
- You can run the script by executing the following command:

- Copy code:
```python password_generator.py```

The script will prompt you to enter the minimum length for the password and whether you want to include numbers and special characters.
## Example of running code
- Here's an example of how to use the password generator:

```Enter the minimum length: 12
Do you want to have numbers (y/n)?: y
Do you want to have special char (y/n)?: n
The generated password is: Dkf3ghA7F9Ls
```


## Customizing the Password
You can customize the password generation by modifying the following parameters in the generate_password function:

1. `min_length`: Set the minimum length for the password.
2. `numbers`: Set to True if you want to include numbers in the password, False otherwise.
3. `special_characters`: Set to True if you want to include special characters in the password, False otherwise.
Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
